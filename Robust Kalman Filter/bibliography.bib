abstract = "Satellites are known as a remotely operated systems with high degree of complexity due to large number of interconnected devices onboard the satellite. Consequently, it has corresponding significant number of telemetry parameters to allow operator and designers have full control and monitor of satellite mode of operation. The tremendous amount of telemetry data received from the satellite, during its lifetime, has to be analyzed in order to monitor and control subsystems health for better decision making and fast responsively. In this research, we address the topic of using machine learning techniques to diagnose faults of satellite subsystems using its telemetry parameters. The case study and source of telemetry are acquired from Egyptsat-1 satellite which has been launched April 2007 and lost communication with ground station last 2010. We applied Machine learning techniques in order to identify operating modes and corresponding telemetry parameters. We used Support Vector Machine for Regression to analyze the satellite performance; then a fault diagnosis approach is applied to determine the most probable reason of this satellite failure. Telemetry data is clustered using k-means clustering algorithm in combination with t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) function for dimensionality reduction. We classified data using Logical Analysis of Data (LAD) in order to generate positive patterns for each failure class which is used to determine probability failure cause for each telemetry parameter. These probabilities enable Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) to get the most probable cause that lead to satellite failure."

@article{Cilden-Guler2021,
abstract = {A three-axis attitude estimation scheme is presented using a set of albedo interfered coarse sun sensors (CSSs) of Earth, which are inexpensive, small in size, and light in power consumption. For modeling the interference, a two-stage albedo estimation algorithm based on autoregressive model is proposed. The algorithm does not require any data, such as albedo coefficients, spacecraft position, sky condition, or ground coverage, other than albedo measurements. The results are compared with five albedo models on the basis of two reference conditions. The estimated albedo is fed to the CSS measurements for correction. The corrected CSS measurements are processed under three estimation techniques with two different sensor configurations. The relative performance of the attitude estimation schemes when using different albedo models is examined.},

@article{DeSilva2020,
abstract = {We develop data-driven algorithms to fully automate sensor fault detection in systems governed by underlying physics. The proposed machine learning method uses a time series of typical behavior to approximate the evolution of measurements of interest by a linear time-invariant system. Given additional data from related sensors, a Kalman observer is used to maintain a separate real-time estimate of the measurement of interest. Sustained deviation between the measurements and the estimate is used to detect anomalous behavior. A decision tree, informed by integrating other sensor measurement values, is used to determine the amount of deviation required to identify a sensor fault. We validate the method by applying it to three test systems exhibiting various types of sensor faults: commercial flight test data, an unsteady aerodynamics model with dynamic stall, and a model for longitudinal flight dynamics forced by atmospheric turbulence. In the latter two cases we test fault detection for several prototypical failure modes. The combination of a learned dynamical model with the automated decision tree accurately detects sensor faults in each case.},
