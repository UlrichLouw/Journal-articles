abstract = "Satellites are known as a remotely operated systems with high degree of complexity due to large number of interconnected devices onboard the satellite. Consequently, it has corresponding significant number of telemetry parameters to allow operator and designers have full control and monitor of satellite mode of operation. The tremendous amount of telemetry data received from the satellite, during its lifetime, has to be analyzed in order to monitor and control subsystems health for better decision making and fast responsively. In this research, we address the topic of using machine learning techniques to diagnose faults of satellite subsystems using its telemetry parameters. The case study and source of telemetry are acquired from Egyptsat-1 satellite which has been launched April 2007 and lost communication with ground station last 2010. We applied Machine learning techniques in order to identify operating modes and corresponding telemetry parameters. We used Support Vector Machine for Regression to analyze the satellite performance; then a fault diagnosis approach is applied to determine the most probable reason of this satellite failure. Telemetry data is clustered using k-means clustering algorithm in combination with t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) function for dimensionality reduction. We classified data using Logical Analysis of Data (LAD) in order to generate positive patterns for each failure class which is used to determine probability failure cause for each telemetry parameter. These probabilities enable Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) to get the most probable cause that lead to satellite failure."

By introducing a nonlinear observer, the healthy sensor measurements are provided. Considering attitude dynamics and kinematic, a novel observer is developed to detect the fault in angular rate as well as attitude sensors individually or simultaneously. There is no limit on type and configuration of attitude sensors. By designing a state feedback based control signal and Lyapunov stability criterion, the uniformly ultimately boundedness of tracking errors in the presence of sensor faults is guaranteed. Finally, simulation results are presented to illustrate the performance of the integrated scheme.},

@article{Zhou2016,
	abstract = {This paper presents a scheme for satellite multi-sensor fault-tolerant attitude estimation. It can both detect a faulty sensor online and conduct fault tolerance in time. First, a satellite attitude estimator based on error states is presented as the unified filter algorithm, in which the filter state equation is built with the gyro model and satellite kinematics, and the measurement equations are built with angle sensors. Meanwhile, typical fault models of the angle sensors are given. Then, a fault-tolerant federated Kalman filter (FTFKF) scheme is designed. Its three sub-filters include the respective angle sensors and share the public gyro measurement. Under the sensor fault condition, a FTFKF can detect the faulty sensor by contrasting and analysing the dimensionless fault detection factors and then selectively fusing the sub-filters' outputs to enable the satellite attitude determination accuracy to approach normal. The comparative analysis of simulation results in typical fault cases shows that the proposed satellite multi-sensor fault-tolerant attitude estimation scheme may achieve the expected fault-tolerant performance. It is promising for enhancing the reliability of satellite attitude determination and control systems.},

The errors of the UKF are derived and sufficient conditions for the convergence of the UKF are presented. As the local approach is a powerful statistical technique for detecting changes in the mean of a Gaussian process, it is used to devise a hypothesis test to detect faults from residuals obtained from the UKF. Further, it is demonstrated that the selection of a sample number is important in improving the performance of the local approach.

	abstract = {Spacecraft health monitoring and failure prevention are major issues in space operations. In recent years, machine learning techniques have received an increasing interest in many fields and have been applied to housekeeping telemetry data via semi-supervised learning. The idea is to use past telemetry describing normal spacecraft behaviour in order to learn a reference model to which can be compared most recent data in order to detect potential anomalies. This paper introduces a new machine learning method for anomaly detection in telemetry time series based on a sparse representation and dictionary learning. The main advantage of the proposed method is the possibility to handle multivariate telemetry time series described by mixed continuous and discrete parameters, taking into account the potential correlations between these parameters. The proposed method is evaluated on a representative anomaly dataset obtained from real satellite telemetry with an available ground-truth and compared to state-of-the-art algorithms.},

@article{Mudinas2020,
	abstract = {The singular value decomposition of a matrix A is the factorization of A into the product of three matrices A = U DV T where the columns of U and V are orthonormal and the matrix D is diagonal with positive real entries. The SVD is useful in many tasks. Here we mention some examples. First, in many applications, the data matrix A is close to a matrix of low rank and it is useful to find a low rank matrix which is a good approximation to the data matrix. We will show that from the singular value decomposition of A, we can get the matrix B of rank k which best approximates A; in fact we can do this for every k. Also, singular value decomposition is defined for all matrices (rectangular or square) unlike the more commonly used spectral decomposition in Linear Algebra. The reader familiar with eigenvectors and eigenvalues (we do not assume familiarity here) will also realize that we need conditions on the matrix to ensure orthogonality of eigenvectors. In contrast, the columns of V in the singular value decomposition, called the right singular vectors of A, always form an orthogonal set with no assumptions on A. The columns of U are called the left singular vectors and they also form an orthogonal set. A simple consequence of the orthogonality is that for a square and invertible matrix A, the inverse of A is V D −1 U T , as the reader can verify. To gain insight into the SVD, treat the rows of an n × d matrix A as n points in a d-dimensional space and consider the problem of finding the best k-dimensional subspace with respect to the set of points. Here best means minimize the sum of the squares of the perpendicular distances of the points to the subspace. We begin with a special case of the problem where the subspace is 1-dimensional, a line through the origin. We will see later that the best-fitting k-dimensional subspace can be found by k applications of the best fitting line algorithm. Finding the best fitting line through the origin with respect to a set of points {x i |1 ≤ i ≤ n} in the plane means minimizing the sum of the squared distances of the points to the line. Here distance is measured perpendicular to the line. The problem is called the best least squares fit.},

	abstract = {Intruders have become more and more sophisticated thus a deterrence mechanism such as an intrusion detection systems (IDS) is pivotal in information security management. An IDS aims at capturing and repealing any malignant activities in the network before they can cause harmful destruction. An IDS relies on a well-trained classification model so the model is able to identify the presence of attacks effectively. This paper compares the performance of IDS by exerting random forest classifier with respect to two performance measures, i.e. accuracy and false alarm rate. Three public intrusion data sets, i.e NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15, and GPRS are employed in the experiment. Furthermore, different tree-size ensembles are considered whilst other best learning parameters are obtained using a grid search. Our experimental results prove the superiority of random forest model for IDS as it significantly outperforms the similar ensemble, i.e. ensemble of random tree + naive bayes tree and other single classifier, i.e. naive bayes and neural network in terms of k-cross validation method.},

The efficacy of the proposed approach is demonstrated through experiments on benchmark data sets. We further use the proposed classifier to detect mitotic nuclei in the histopathological data sets of breast tissues.

	abstract = {A random forest (RF) predictor is an ensemble of individual tree predictors. As part of their construction, RF predictors naturally lead to a dissimilarity measure between the observations. One can also define an RF dissimilarity measure between unlabeled data: the idea is to construct an RF predictor that distinguishes the "observed" data from suitably generated synthetic data. The observed data are the original unlabeled data and the synthetic data are drawn from a reference distribution. Here we describe the properties of the RF dissimilarity and make recommendations on how to use it in practice. An RF dissimilarity can be attractive because it handles mixed variable types well, is invariant to monotonic transformations of the input variables, and is robust to outlying observations. The RF dissimilarity easily deals with a large number of variables due to its intrinsic variable selection; for example, the Addcl1 RF dissimilarity weighs the contribution of each variable according to how dependent it is on other variables. We find that the RF dissimilarity is useful for detecting tumor sample clusters on the basis of tumor marker expressions. In this application, biologically meaningful clusters can often be described with simple thresholding rules. {\textcopyright} 2006 American Statistical Association.},

With the advances of information technologies, product operating data collected through continuous condition monitoring (CM) serve as main sources for analysis of performance and detection of anomaly. Most of the existing anomaly detection methods, however, are not effective when CM data are very high dimensional, leading to poor quality of assessment results. Besides, the effects of multiple operating conditions on anomaly detection are seldom considered in these existing methods. To solve these problems, an integrated approach for anomaly detection and critical behavioral attributes identification based on CM data is developed in this research. Gaussian mixed model GMM) is employed to develop a method for clustering of operating conditions. Isolation forest (iForest) method is used to detect anomaly instances, and further to identify the critical attributes related to product performance degradation. The effectiveness of the developed approach is demonstrated by an application with collected operating data of a wind turbine.},

	abstract = {Most existing model-based approaches to anomaly detection construct a profile of normal instances, then identify instances that do not conform to the normal profile as anomalies. This paper proposes a fundamentally different model-based method that explicitly isolates anomalies instead of profiles normal points. To our best knowledge, the concept of isolation has not been explored in current literature. The use of isolation enables the proposed method, iForest, to exploit sub-sampling to an extent that is not feasible in existing methods, creating an algorithm which has a linear time complexity with a low constant and a low memory requirement. Our empirical evaluation shows that iFor-est performs favourably to ORCA, a near-linear time complexity distance-based method, LOF and Random Forests in terms of AUC and processing time, and especially in large data sets. iForest also works well in high dimensional problems which have a large number of irrelevant attributes, and in situations where training set does not contain any anomalies.},

	abstract = {This paper attempts to characterize failure behaviour of small satellites through statistical analysis of actual in-orbit failures. A unique Small Satellite Anomalies Database comprising empirical failure data of 222 small satellites has been developed. A nonparametric analysis of the failure data has been implemented by means of a Kaplan-Meier estimation. An innovative modelling method, i.e. Bayesian theory in combination with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations, has been proposed to model the reliability of small satellites. An extensive parametric analysis using the Bayesian/MCMC method has been performed to fit a Weibull distribution to the data. The influence of several characteristics such as the design lifetime, mass, launch year, mission type and the type of satellite developers on the reliability has been analyzed. The results clearly show the infant mortality of small satellites. Compared with the classical maximum-likelihood estimation methods, the proposed Bayesian/MCMC method results in better fitting Weibull models and is especially suitable for reliability modelling where only very limited failures are observed. {\textcopyright} 2014 2014 IAA.

@article{Jacklin2019,
	abstract = {The purpose of this report is to determine the failure rate of small-satellite missions launched between the years 2000 and 2016. This analysis considers the rates of both partial and total mission failure, as well as the failures attributable to failure of the launch vehicle. This study observed that between the years of 2000 to 2016, 41.3{\%} of all small satellites launched failed or partially failed. Of these small satellite missions, 24.2{\%} were total mission failures, another 11{\%} were partial mission failures, and 6.1{\%} were launch vehicle failures. The small satellite failure data reveals an increase in the failure rate as the yearly launch rate has increased. The period 2000 to 2008 averaged 15 launches per year, during which 28.6{\%} of the small satellite missions failed or partially failed. The period from 2009 to 2016 averaged 48 launches per year, during which 42.6{\%} of the small satellite missions failed or partially failed. The launch vehicle failure rate for both periods was the same at around 6.1{\%}. The implication is that for modern small satellite missions, almost one out of every two small satellite missions will result in either a total or a partial mission failure. Counting the partial mission successes as “successful missions” reduces the failure rate, but only to 38.2{\%} for the period 2009 to 2016. Appendix A provides a list of the small satellite missions that failed or partially failed during the years 2000 to 2016. The causes of failures are identified when known. Appendix B provides a list of the successful small satellites launched between 2000 and 2016.},

@article{Crowell2011,
	abstract = {Attitude Determination and Control Systems (ADCS) are critical to the operation of satel- lites that require attitude knowledge and/or attitude control to achieve mission success. Furthermore, ADCS systems only operate as designed in the reduced friction, micro-gravity environment of space. Simulating these characteristics of space in a laboratory environment in order to test individual ADCS components and integrated ADCS systems is an important but challenging step in verifying and validating a satellite's ADCS design. The purpose of this thesis is to design and develop an ADCS testbed capable of sim- ulating the reduced fiction, micro-gravity environment of space within the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Space Systems Laboratory. The ADCS testbed is based on a table- top style, three degree of freedom, rotational air bearing, which uses four reaction wheels for attitude control and a series of sensors for attitude determination. The testbed includes all the equipment necessary to allow for closed loop testing of individual ADCS components and integrated ADCS systems in the simulated inertial environment of space. In addition to the physical ADCS testbed, a MATLAB Simulink based model of the ADCS testbed is developed to predict the performance of hardware components and software algorithms before the components and algorithms are integrated into the ADCS testbed. The final objective of this thesis is to validate the operation of the ADCS testbed and simulation to prepare the tool for use by satellite design teams.},

@article{Choi2011,
	abstract = {While numerous anomalies and failures of spacecraft have been reported since the beginning of the space age, space weather effects on modern spacecraft systems have been emphasized more and more with the increase of their complexity and capability. However, the relationship between space weather and commercial satellite anomalies has not been studied extensively. In this paper, we investigate the geostationary Earth orbit (GEO) satellite anomalies archived by Satellite News Digest during 19972009 in order to search for possible influences of space weather on the anomaly occurrences. We analyze spacecraft anomalies for the Kp index, local time, and season and then compare them with the tendencies of charged particles observed by Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) satellites. We obtain the following results: (1) there are good relationships between geomagnetic activity (as measured by the Kp index) and anomaly occurrences of the GEO satellites; (2) the satellite anomalies occurred mainly in the midnight to morning sector; and (3) the anomalies are found more frequently in spring and fall than summer and winter. While we cannot fully explain how space weather is involved in producing such anomalies, our analysis of LANL data shows that low-energy ( {\textless} 100 keV) electrons have similar behaviors with spacecraft anomalies and implies the spacecraft charging might dominantly contribute to the GEO spacecraft anomalies reported in Satellite News Digest.

@article{Cilden-Guler2021,
abstract = {A three-axis attitude estimation scheme is presented using a set of albedo interfered coarse sun sensors (CSSs) of Earth, which are inexpensive, small in size, and light in power consumption. For modeling the interference, a two-stage albedo estimation algorithm based on autoregressive model is proposed. The algorithm does not require any data, such as albedo coefficients, spacecraft position, sky condition, or ground coverage, other than albedo measurements. The results are compared with five albedo models on the basis of two reference conditions. The estimated albedo is fed to the CSS measurements for correction. The corrected CSS measurements are processed under three estimation techniques with two different sensor configurations. The relative performance of the attitude estimation schemes when using different albedo models is examined.},

@article{DeSilva2020,
abstract = {We develop data-driven algorithms to fully automate sensor fault detection in systems governed by underlying physics. The proposed machine learning method uses a time series of typical behavior to approximate the evolution of measurements of interest by a linear time-invariant system. Given additional data from related sensors, a Kalman observer is used to maintain a separate real-time estimate of the measurement of interest. Sustained deviation between the measurements and the estimate is used to detect anomalous behavior. A decision tree, informed by integrating other sensor measurement values, is used to determine the amount of deviation required to identify a sensor fault. We validate the method by applying it to three test systems exhibiting various types of sensor faults: commercial flight test data, an unsteady aerodynamics model with dynamic stall, and a model for longitudinal flight dynamics forced by atmospheric turbulence. In the latter two cases we test fault detection for several prototypical failure modes. The combination of a learned dynamical model with the automated decision tree accurately detects sensor faults in each case.},
