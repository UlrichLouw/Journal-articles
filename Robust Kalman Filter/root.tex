\begin{abstract}

The Kalman Filter is a state estimator that is often used in attitude determination of satellites. A Kalman filter is highly sensitive to anomalies that occur in sensors. A good example of this is the reflection of a solar panel on a sun sensor that changes the perceived sun vector. This in term influences the estimation of the attitude by the kalman filter and consequently the control of the satellite. Detecting anomalies in sensors and omitting the sensor reading from the measurement update of the Kalman Filter could increase the stability and reliability of the Kalman filter for satellite attitude determination.

\section{Sensor anomalies}
List of sensor anomalies and a model of specific anomalies. (solar panel reflection)

\subsection{Reflection}`
Previous work done by \textcite{Cilden-Guler2021} provides models that determine albedo effects from the earth and adjust the CSS measurements to improve accuracy.
he assumption is made that the solar panel can be modelled as a simple plane. Therefore light that hits the solar panel will reflect as if it hits a perfectly smooth mirror. It is also assumed that if any reflection from the solar panel hits the sun sensor, the sun sensor will then default to the reflection ray instead of the modelled sun vector. The reflected sun vector, $R$, can be calculated as
\begin{equation}
	R = V - 2N^T(V \cdot N)
\end{equation}
Where $V$ is the incoming sun vector and $N$ is the normal vector to the plan $ABCD$ of the solar panel as seen in Figure~\ref{fig:CubeSat}. To calculate the intersection of the reflected vector with the plane $xwyz$ of the sun sensor the intersecting point the equation of the plane, reflected vector and the point of origin is required. The equation for a plane can be denoted as 

\begin{equation}
	P = ax + by + cz = d
	\label{eq:Plane}
\end{equation}

The reflected vector can also be translated to equations of 

\begin{equation}
	\begin{aligned}
	&	x = \alpha t \\
	&	y = \beta t \\
	&	z = \zeta t \\
	\end{aligned}
\label{eq:LineOfVector}
\end{equation}

Since we can calculate the coefficients for Eq~\ref{eq:LineOfVector} from the reflected vector, we can calculate $t$, by substituting $x, y \& z$ into Eq~\ref{eq:Plane}. Consequently the intersecting points $x$, $y$ and $z$ can be calculated as

\begin{equation}
	P(x, y, z) = (o_1 + \alpha t, o_2 + \beta t, o_3 + \zeta t)
	\label{eq:Intersection}
\end{equation}
where $o_1, o_2, o_3$ is the points of origin, in this case the points on the solar panel.

	\caption{Reflection}
	\label{fig:ReflectionPoints}
\end{figure}

To model reflection from the solar panels to the sun sensor only two corners of the solar panel and two corners of the sun sensor can be taken into account. From Figure~\ref{fig:ReflectionPoints} it is evident that if the solar panel reflects on corner $y$ that corner $x$ will also receive light from the reflection. The same is true for corner $z$ and $w$. Since $C'$ will be at the exact same position as $C$, the reflection from the sun does not need to be calculated for $C$, this is also true for $D$. Therefore it is only necessary to calculate the reflected positions $A'$ and $B'$.

The reflected position $A'$ can be calculated as the intersection of the reflected vector $RR'$ with plane $xyzw$ with Eq~\ref{eq:Intersection}. We also know the position of $A$, based pon the dimensions of the solar panel, consequently we can calculate $A'$. The same applies to $B$ and $B'$. To then determine whether $y$ or $x$ is within the region of reflection, we calculate whether $x$ is between the lines of $A'D'$ and $B'C$ as well as between the lines $ACD$ and $A'B'$. This is done by calculating the coordinates of $X_{B'C}$, $X_{A'D}$, $X_{A'B}$ and $X_{CD}$ to determine if $X$ is in the reflection zone, which can be done with logical if statements.

\section{Anomaly Detection}
To be able to recover from sensor anomalies or to exclude the sensor from the kalman filter, the anomaly must be detected and the sensor from which the anomaly in the data occurs must be classified.

\subsection{Detection}
The first step to implementing a FDIR for kalman filter robustness is to detect whether an anomaly has occured on one of the filters. There are various different methods for fault detection, with both supervised and unsupervised methods. However this study will only focus on a single method proposed by \textcite{DeSilva2020} to detect failures in sensors.

The proposed method by \textcite{DeSilva2020} uses Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD), which was originally developed by \textcite{schmid2011applications} and further expanded to include control by \textcite{proctor2016dynamic}, to provide an estimation of a sensor vector based on the previous measurement fo the sensor as well as the measurements of the other sensors in the system. DMD was first developed in the fluids community and constructs a matrix $\mathbf{A}$ to relate the state vector $x$ with the following time step of the state vector, $x_{k+1}$. The state vector in our case will be the measurement vector of the specific sensor that we want to monitor.
\begin{equation}
	x_{k+1} = \mathbf{A}x_k
\end{equation}
Where $x_k$ and $x_{k+1}$ over a time period will be denoted as $\mathbf{X}$ and $\mathbf{X'}$ respectively.

The method of DMD however is useful for high order systems where the calculation of $\mathbf{A}$ is computation intensive. This is not the case for our system and using DMD is not justifiable. Therefore we calculate the pseudo-inverse of $\mathbf{X}$, denote it as $\mathbf{X^{\dagger}}$, and $\mathbf{A}$ can be calculate as
\begin{equation}
	\mathbf{A} = \mathbf{X}\mathbf{X^{\dagger}}
\end{equation}
This necessitates the required data for the state vector. The article by \textcite{DeSilva2020} however includes the $\mathbf{B}$ to relate the vector measurements of the other sensors to adjust the predicted state, $x_{k+1}$ of the monitored sensor. 
\begin{equation}
	x_{k+1} = \boldsymbol{A}x_k + \boldsymbol{B}y_k
	\label{control DMD}
\end{equation}
Where $y_k$ is the other sensor measurements. This is adjusted for our use case, where $y_k$ is the control inputs for the magnetotorquers and reaction wheels and $x_k$ is all of the sensor measurements. Consequently, the model of \ref{control DMD} denotes the prediction of the sensor measurements in time step $k+1$ based on the current sensor measurements and control inputs.
Thereafter, as implemented by \textcite{DeSilva2020} the model is adjusted by with a Kalman Filter. From $\boldsymbol{A}$ and $\boldsymbol{B}$ the Kalman filter can be implemented to predict $x_{k+1}$
\begin{equation}
	\hat{x}_{k+1} = A\hat{x}_k + By_k + K(x_k - \hat{x}_k)
\end{equation}
After  the calculation of $\hat{x}_{k+1}$ \textcite{DeSilva2020} proposes a moving average of the innovation covariance
\begin{equation}
	\boldsymbol{V}_k = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=k-N}^k (x_i - \hat{x}_i)(x_i - \hat{x}_i)^T
\end{equation}
The moving average is used as an additional input parameter to a decision tree that classifies binary anomalies based on the $\boldsymbol{x_k}$. According to

Decision Tree (Discuss gini index). Gini index is the measure of the probability of a particle variable being wrongly chosen when it is randomly chosen.

\begin{equation}
GI = 1 - \sum_{i = 1}^{n}{(P_i)^2}
\end{equation}

\end{figure}

\subsection{Isolation}
Decision tree or any other multi-classifying method.

\end{figure}


\subsection{Recovery}
Backtracking on kalman filter... Removing sensor measurement update... If a fault is predicted, the estimated vector model from the kalman filter is used to to determine the reference position for the control as well as the calculations for the control.

\section{Testing methodology}
Simulation... Induce anomalies based on physical models or at a specified timestamp.

\section{Results}
Three scenarios are implemented, a satellite that never experiences reflection, a satellite that experiences reflection without any recovery method and a satellite with a recovery method. The subsets of detecting the fault and recovering from the fault will be isolated and discussed separately. Therefore the results for recovery based on perfect detection can be shown to show the possibilities of the recovery method.

The simulation is run for 20 orbits, with each orbit running for 5700$s$. If a fault is induced, it is induced after the first two orbits and the specific anomaly then occurs for the following 18 orbits.
